This is a personal project of an incremental game, in Kotlin, entirely created from scratch.

## List of Ideas
---------

The list of things I would like to experience through this project (non-exhaustive list and subject to change) :

* Put all the code in English
* Information icons for each production
  * Pop-up with funny "lore" about the production
* Saving the game in real-time
* Settings in the top right corner
  * Support English and French
  * Allow hard reset
* A gacha system for "managers" (called "butcher"?)
* Integrate ads (google)
* Create APK
* Publish game on PlayStore
