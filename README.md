# Make More Meat

This is a personal project of an incremental game, in Kotlin, entirely created from scratch.

---------

## List of things I have currently experimented and implemented :

* The basics of Kotlin languages
* Linking UI and code in Android/Kotlin
* Use Android's sharedPreferences for backups

---------

## List of things I still want to experience through the project :

* Daily Login Bonus
* Saving the game in real-time (with play games ?)
* Support English and French
* A gacha system (for butchers)
* Integrate ads (google)
* Anti-Cheat
* Create APK
* Publish game on PlayStore
